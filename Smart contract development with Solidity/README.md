These are random notes taken during the course.

### Blockchain basics

Hash: Unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data
Hash algorithm: A function that computes data into a unique hash
Genesis block: The first block in a blockchain
Mining: The process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
Block: A list of transactions mined together
Decentralized: Having no single point of authority

Private key --> Public Key --> Address

Blockchain nodes keep lists of the transactions that occur.

Decentralized - Secure - Scalable

Gas is _a measure of how much it costs someone to transact on the blockchain_.

**`Value`**: The amount to be transferred to the recipient with the transaction

**`Transaction fee`**: Amount paid to process the transaction in Ether and fiat value (Gas Price * Gas Used by Transaction)

**`Gas Price`**: The Price offered to the block producer to purchase this amount of GAS(per GAS)

The more people send transactions at the same time the more expensive your gas costs are.
